    "### Sensor Setup\n",
    "Various sensors are built in the UAV. The flight control system Pixhawk (see section 1.2.2 on\n",
    "page 3) already comes with a gyroscope, an accelerometer/magnetometer and a barometer. Additionally\n",
    "a GPS unit, a digital airspeed sensor and a light detection and ranging (LiDAR)\n",
    "altitude estimator are equipped and connected to the Pixhawk. The system has been complemented\n",
    "with an air data boom during the process of this work (see section 4.5).\n",
    "#### Gyroscope/Magnetometer/Accelerometer\n",
    "The Pixhawk Autopilot system is mounted roughly at the center of gravity of the UAV. It\n",
    "contains a three-axis digital output gyroscope L3GD20H (see data sheet [30]). Furthermore,\n",
    "the LSM303D, a combination of a magnetometer and accelerometer (see data sheet [31]) is built\n",
    "in the system. These three sensors are meant to keep track of the orientation of the UAV.\n",
    "#### Barometer\n",
    "The barometer implemented in the Pixhawk is a MS5611-01BA (see data sheet [32]) from the\n",
    "company MEAS in Switzerland. The barometric pressure sensor provides a precise (1-2% error)\n",
    "24 bit pressure and temperature value. The piezoresistive sensor built in the barometer delivers\n",
    "an uncompensated analogue output voltage, which is then converted to a digital 24 bit output\n",
    "by the sensor interface.\n",
    "#### GPS\n",
    "The GPS module 3DR uBlox (see data sheet [33]) is built in the UAV. It has a position accuracy\n",
    "of 2:5m and comes with a compass, so to speak, an additional magnetometer.\n",
    "#### Digital Airspeed Sensor\n",
    "The airspeed indicator Pixhawk Airspeed Sensor Kit (see data sheet [34]) is used. It comes with\n",
    "a pitot tube equipped with a pressure sensor of the type 4525DO and is attached below the\n",
    "wings facing forward.\n",
    "#### Air Data Boom\n",
    "To measure the AOA $\\alpha$ and the AOS $\\beta$ the UAV needs an air data boom (ADB). A sensor of\n",
    "this kind was built and attached to the UAV during this work. It is connected to the spine and\n",
    "comes out at the very tip of the nose. Therefore the ADB is just usable with the dummy nose."
